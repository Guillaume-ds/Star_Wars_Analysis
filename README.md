# Star_Wars_Analysis
Analysis of data about Star Wars Viewers I am using a data set posted by "fivethirtyheight" on github : "https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey" The data set can be divided in two parts : specific questions about Star Wars and questions about the respondent 

I made this project in order to gain experience with pandas and numpy libraries. 

I present the outcomes in a .ppt file
